##### ALGORITHM #####

The auto-scaling algorithm works by taking the average response
time within a timing window and see if its within a minimum
or maximum threshold. If so, scale up or down.

1. Check if queue has any response time values stored (clients POST to fill this queue)
    - if empty, calculate average using sum and length
    - if not empty, dequeue value and add to sum

2. Check if the average is within threshold values.
    - if avg is larger than max_threshold, proceed, else go to step x
    - if avg is smaller than min_threshold, proceed, else go to step x

3.
  - If avg is larger, check if scaling would result in more replicas than 'max_replica'
      - If yes, go to step x.
      - If no proceed

  - If avg is smaller, check if scaling would result in less replicas than 'min_replica'
      - If yes, go to step x.
      - If no proceed

4.
  - If avg is larger, scale up (add more replicas) by 'scale_step' amount
  - If avg is smaller, scale down (remove replicas) by 'scale_step' amount

5. Sleep for 'poll_interval' seconds


##### PARAMETERS #####

The default configuration has the following values:

poll_interval: 15
scale_step: 1
scale_up_threshold: 3 (TODO: UPDATE THIS)
scale_down_threshold: 2 (TODO: UPDATE THIS)
max_replica: 20
min_replica: 1
